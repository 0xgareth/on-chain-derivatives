## Interest rate swaps

Interest rate swaps are foundational to financial markets, they offer the ability to swap payments of a variable interest rate into fixed, or vice versa.

> In an interest rate swap, one company agrees to pay to another company cash flows equal to interest at a predetermined fixed rate on a notional principal for a predetermined number of years. In return, it  receives interest at a floating rate on the same notional principal for the same period of time from the other company.
